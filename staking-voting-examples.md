# Staking, Voting, Withdrawing Examples 
This document explains the basics of staking and voting, staking more KNC, and withdrawing KNC with 3 examples.

## Basic Staking And Voting
Staking and voting are done in epochs, which sounds scary, but it really just means fixed periods of time, determined by the timestamps of the mined Ethereum blocks. The duration of every KyberDAO epoch will be 2 weeks. The timestamp of the first epoch will be decided at a later stage.

*   Epoch 10: Tom stakes 10,000 KNC. He cannot vote with this stake in this epoch.
*   Epoch 11: He will be able to vote with his 10,000 KNC 
*   Epoch 12:  He will be able to claim his participation reward from the last epoch. There is no need to restake, he can continue to vote. Any unclaimed rewards can be claimed at any moment.

## Staking More KNC
Assuming Tom loves Kyber and decides to play a bigger role in voting:

*   Epoch 13: He buys 5,000 more KNC and stakes it as well. His voting power for this epoch is still the amount staked at the beginning of the epoch, which is 10,000 KNC. 
*   Epoch 14: He can claim rewards for the 10,000 KNC voting power in the previous epoch. Starting from this epoch, he will be voting with 15,000 KNC.
*   Epoch 15: He can claim rewards for the 15,000 KNC that he voted with in the previous epoch

## Withdrawing Stakes
If Tom withdraws his stake at any point during the epoch, his voting power (and hence rewards) for that epoch will be counted as the **lowest amount he had after voting**.

For example, in epoch 16, Tom voted while having 15K KNC, then midway through the epoch he withdrew 3K KNC. Although he voted while having 15K KNC, his voting power will only be counted as 12K KNC. Hence, in Epoch 17, he will receive rewards only for 12K KNC.

If he re-stakes back his 3K KNC to bring his total stake to 15K KNC again, in epoch 17 he will still receive rewards only for 12K KNC.

In other words, even after voting in epoch 16, Tom needs to voluntarily keep his 15K KNC staked throughout epoch 16 (without withdrawing any amount), in order to claim his full rewards in epoch 17.
